# Energy_consumption_forecasting

Using an LSTM and a Dual-stage Attention-based RNN for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting. The DA-RNN implementation is based on this repository - https://github.com/Seanny123/da-rnn.

### For both models run Energy_Consumption.ipynb. The other files contain utility functions for training, testing and the model class

Thanks to Seanny123 for his nice implentation of the DA-RNN
